# electron-ps-rs

PureScript Halogen desktop app with a Rust backend: A minified example.

## Motivation

Electron lets you build the ui for your desktop apps with the same tools used to build web uis which are best in class when it comes to performance, flexibility, and ecosystem maturity.

This repo is a POC for getting all the pieces to work together at all before using it in more substantial projects.

## Full Stack
- PureScript Halogen
